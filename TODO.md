# TODO: ANS/Forth conformity gap analysis

_Last updated: 2025-11-28_

Goal
- Compare the current implementation against the ANS Forth core wordlist and identify words that are missing or partially implemented.

Method
- A scan of `Primitive` attributes and tests in the repository is used to determine what exists. Tool `tools/ans-diff` automates comparison and can fail CI on missing words.

Status — implemented / obvious support (non-exhaustive)
- Definitions / compilation words: `:`, `;`, `IMMEDIATE`, `POSTPONE`, `[`, `]`, `'`, `LITERAL`
- Control flow: `IF`, `ELSE`, `THEN`, `BEGIN`, `WHILE`, `REPEAT`, `UNTIL`, `DO`, `LOOP`, `LEAVE`, `UNLOOP`, `I`, `RECURSE`
- Defining words: `CREATE`, `DOES>`, `VARIABLE`, `CONSTANT`, `VALUE`, `TO`, `DEFER`, `IS`, `MARKER`, `FORGET`
- Stack / memory: `@`, `!`, `C@`, `C!`, `,`, `ALLOT`, `HERE`, `COUNT`, `MOVE`, `FILL`, `ERASE`
- I/O: `.`, `.S`, `CR`, `EMIT`, `TYPE`, `WORDS`, pictured numeric (`<#`, `HOLD`, `#`, `#S`, `SIGN`, `#>`)
- File I/O (subset): `READ-FILE`, `WRITE-FILE`, `APPEND-FILE`, `FILE-EXISTS`, `INCLUDE`, `LOAD`
  - Stream primitives: `OPEN-FILE`, `CLOSE-FILE`, `FILE-SIZE`, `REPOSITION-FILE`
  - Byte-level handle ops: `READ-FILE-BYTES`, `WRITE-FILE-BYTES`
  - Diagnostics (DEBUG): `LAST-WRITE-BYTES`, `LAST-READ-BYTES`
  - Diagnostics (DEBUG): `_lastWriteBuffer/_lastReadBuffer` diagnostics accessible for tests
- Async / concurrency: `SPAWN`, `FUTURE`, `TASK`, `JOIN`, `AWAIT`, `TASK?` (+ generic awaitable support)
- Exceptions / control: `CATCH`, `THROW`, `ABORT`, `EXIT`, `BYE`, `QUIT`
- Numeric base & parsing: `BASE`, `HEX`, `DECIMAL`, `>NUMBER` (extended), `STATE`
- Introspection: `SEE` (module-qualified + decompile text)
- Wordlist/search-order: `GET-ORDER`, `SET-ORDER`, `WORDLIST`, `DEFINITIONS`, `FORTH`
- Interactive input: `KEY`, `KEY?`, `ACCEPT`, `EXPECT`, `SOURCE`, `>IN`, `READ-LINE`
- Extended arithmetic: `*/MOD` plus double-cell ops `D+`, `D-`, `M*`
- Environment queries: `ENV` wordlist with `OS`, `CPU`, `MEMORY`, `MACHINE`, `USER`, `PWD`
- Help system: `HELP` (general help or word-specific)

Recent extensions
- Inline IL: stabilized `IL{ ... }IL`
  - DynamicMethod signature now `(ForthInterpreter intr, ForthStack stack)`; `ldarg.0` is interpreter, `ldarg.1` is stack
  - Local type inference (declare `object` for `Pop()` results, `long` for arithmetic); consistent `LocalBuilder`-based `ldloc/stloc/ldloca`
  - Normalize non-virtual method calls to `call` even if `callvirt` token is used
  - Added comprehensive tests for fixed-slot/short/inline locals, increment, and POP/PUSH via interpreter and via `ForthStack`
- `TYPE` now supports: plain string, counted string address, (addr u) memory form, and string+length form; rejects bare numeric per tests.
- `WRITE-FILE` / `APPEND-FILE` accept string, counted string address, or (addr u) memory range.
- `>NUMBER` extended to accept counted string address and (addr u) forms in addition to raw string.
- Tokenizer updated: S" skips at most one leading space; supports accurate literal lengths.
- INCLUDE/LOAD: changed to evaluate entire file contents in a single `EvalAsync` call to preserve bracketed conditional constructs spanning line boundaries.
- Token preprocessing: synthesize common bracket composites (e.g. `[IF]`, `[ELSE]`, `[THEN]`) from separated `[` `IF` `]` sequences so older test sources and style variants are handled.
- `SkipBracketSection` improved to accept both composite tokens and separated bracket sequences when scanning for matching `[ELSE]`/`[THEN]`.
- ACCEPT/EXPECT/READ-LINE: updated to read character-by-character for proper ANS conformity, handling partial reads and CR/LF termination.
- Implemented full file-handle API in the interpreter (`OpenFileHandle`, `CloseFileHandle`, `ReadFileIntoMemory`, `WriteMemoryToFile`) and corresponding Forth words.
  - `WRITE-FILE` / `APPEND-FILE` accept string or counted-string/address forms and populate interpreter diagnostics (`_lastWriteBuffer`, `_lastWritePositionAfter`, `_lastReadBuffer`, etc.) used by tests.
  - Handle-based operations (open/read/write/reposition/close) use share-friendly FileStream modes to allow concurrent reads by other processes/tests.
  - `READ-FILE-BYTES` / `WRITE-FILE-BYTES` validate negative-length inputs and throw `CompileError` as tests expect.
- INCLUDE/LOAD: changed to unquote file arguments and evaluate whole file contents in a single `EvalAsync` call so bracketed conditional constructs spanning lines are preserved.
- Diagnostics: added last-read/last-write buffers and positions so introspection tests can validate live stream behavior.
- Tokenizer updates and bracketed-conditional handling were adjusted earlier; file inclusion behavior complements those changes to avoid unmatched bracket conditionals.
- Fixed generated test dependency on `ttester.4th` by copying it to output directory via project configuration.
- Added ENV wordlist for environment queries (OS, CPU, MEMORY, MACHINE, USER, PWD).
- Enhanced REPL with command history, HELP/STACK commands, and improved error handling.
- Extended HELP primitive to show general help when no word specified.
- Added comprehensive tests validating all README examples.

Notes
- `GET-ORDER`/`SET-ORDER` expose core wordlist sentinel as `FORTH` (internally `null`).
- `ACCEPT`/`EXPECT` currently implement buffer write semantics; review for strict ANS compliance (edge cases like newline handling, partial fills).
- Awaitable detection centralized in `AwaitableHelper`.
- Block system implemented with per-block files + LRU cache + atomic save.
- INCLUDE/LOAD accept quoted string stack arguments and unquote before file access.
- ENV wordlist provides system environment information.
- HELP shows general help or word-specific help.
